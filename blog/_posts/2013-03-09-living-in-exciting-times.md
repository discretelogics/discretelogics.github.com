”We live in the most exciting time!” the professor said back in school spreading his enthusiasm for 
computer science. We had 2000, the internet reached out to everyone, so the field was obviously 
unpreceded excitement. Since then? Even more exciting:


#### Having the Choice
Back then, google invented [Big Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigTable) and applied 
[Map Reduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) to solve their persistence and processing needs, 
<!-- more start -->
demonstrating how software projects should think about their needs before going traditional ways 
(using relational SQL databases). The “NoSQL” movement evolved and new products approached data 
storage and processing in new ways. Alex Popescu's [blog](http://nosql.mypopescu.com/kb/nosql) 
collects citations what poeple actually consider NoSQL to be. “Having the choice” is Jan Lehnardt’s view.

#### Even more Choices
Freed from old traditions, software engineering became a much more creative challenge (a good thing) and - more important - offers many new possibilities. Nearby,
* advances in programming languages,
* developer collaboration (open source projects),
* advances in the software engineering process,
* more powerful operating system features

made it possible that we now see database products started by [single](http://ravendb.net/) [individuals](http://couchdb.com) that compete with the large ones. This is fair competition in favor for all in the discipline, and for customers anyway. And adds even more choices.

#### Decision Time
Choice requires decision, so NoSQL also means "Think before you store and process." 
Understanding the own problem before buying a solution got more challenging then in the old days 
when buying from the big companies was always safe. But the "Nobody gets fired for buying X" rule is no more. And this
is a very good thing. To cope with challenge of choice, software makers compare their own products 
against potentially competitive products, as MongoDB once did with CouchDB, [Riak with MongoDB](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/references/appendices/comparisons/Riak-Compared-to-MongoDB/)
or lately [RethinkDB with MongoDB](http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/comparisons/mongodb/).
In this blog we will share our reasoning about 
time series analysis, vizualisation and persistence 
to help with these decisions. Expect more technical posts following.
