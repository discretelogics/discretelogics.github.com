It is done, today we are pleased to announce the availability of TeaHouse - 
a Windows application to browse and visualize time series like financial, sensor or performance metrics data.

TeaHouse provides the first scrollable chart that loads arbitrary large time series files in some Milliseconds (low 1 digit numbers).
Being able to chart such large time series becomes a necessity 

We tuned data access , files of Gigabyte size open and display within some Milliseconds. 
Arbitrary time series can be visualized by Points, Lines, Histograms, Areas, Bands, Bars and Candles. 
Charts update automatically whenever files change, which allows running TeaHouse beside other analysis tools.
The product complements TeaFiles, the free file format for fast and simple time series storage and is available as a standalone Windows application or as extension to Microsoft Visual Studio. 
TeaHouse can be extended by VSIX Plugins, an extension to download data from Yahoo Finance is freely available.
