            <h2>Discretelogics releases TeaHouse</h2>
            <p><b>Vienna, Austria (March 14, 2013)</b> - Discretelogics is pleased to announce the availability of TeaHouse - a Windows application to browse and visualize time series 
                like financial, sensor or performance metrics data.
            </p>
            <p>Designed for high performance data access, files of Gigabyte size open and display within some Milliseconds. 
                Arbitrary time series can be visualized by Points, Lines, Histograms, Areas, Bands, Bars and Candles. 
                Charts update automatically whenever files change, which allows running TeaHouse beside other analysis tools.
                The product complements TeaFiles, the free file format for fast and simple time series storage and is available as a standalone Windows application or as extension to Microsoft Visual Studio. 
                TeaHouse can be extended by VSIX Plugins, an extension to download data from Yahoo Finance is freely available.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>“There is an endless number of text editors available, but if you need one to open that 4GB log file, you can count them on your hands. The same with time series: If you have a large time series file, sized many MB or GB, TeaHouse will open it within some Milliseconds and allow scrolling through the data. We did not invent the bar chart, but deliver efficient data access with TeaHouse.”</i> says Rainier Gruber, Data Visualization expert at Discretelogics.
