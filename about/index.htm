                    <p>DiscreteLogics creates Teatime, a set of tools for time series storage, visualization and analysis.
            Highest possible performance leads design, followed by well designed programming models and user interfaces.            
            Small tools are easy to evaluate and integrate with existing custom applications or tools like R, Octave/Matlab or Python.            
            Being operating system and programming language agnostic is the goal.
